# Flowers App

## Supabase setup

This project now expects a Supabase project. Create a `.env.local` file and add:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-project-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=optional-server-key
```

Run `npm install` if you haven't since the Supabase dependency was added.
